# Horiseon Website Application

## Description

This project was an on-the-job ticket to improve accessibility. Google and other search engines have evolved, making semantic search a crucial part of Search Engine Optimization (SEO). This application was created for a marketing agency that adheres to accessibility standards and optimises their website for search engines. 

To improve accessibility and SEO, I logically structured semantic HTML elements, consolidated the CSS selectors, added comments to the CSS file, and included a descriptive title.

## Installation

## Usage

Screen readers can be used by individuals with vision impairments to access this website. By using semantic HTML, we provide meaning and context to our web pages. When announced by assistive technology, certain elements do not provide context, such as the div element. As a result, the content on a page is difficult to perceive and understand by users.

To review the semantic HTML elements on this page without a screen reader, you can view the code in GitHub or open the deployed website and access Chrome DevTools. You can open Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Options+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see semantic HTML elements such as header, main, section, aside or footer.

Furthermore, you can run an accessibility and SEO audit with the use of Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools. 
This website scored 97 for accessibility, 92 for best practices and 100 for SEO.
